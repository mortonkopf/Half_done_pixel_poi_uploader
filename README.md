Pixel poi uploader for Teensy
this is an unfinished project to create a Java App to upload pixel poi .ino file to Teensy.

this is now obsolete and here only as historical interest for me. The process for using pixel poi this way is to create arrays for each image to be show. these are then stored in memory on the Teensy.
